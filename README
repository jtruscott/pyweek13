DEPENDENCIES:

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  Python:     http://www.python.org/
  WConio:     http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/wconio.html (Windows)
  PyGame:     http://www.pygame.org/ (Optional, only needed for sound)


RUNNING THE GAME:

    PLEASE NOTE:
        This game is very sensitive to your terminal configuration!
        Windows Users:
            Please use the "Raster Fonts" font. (Right-click the terminal title bar, Properties, Fonts)
            Choose the "8 x 12" font size.
            Other fonts lead to rendering errors.

        Linux/Mac Users:
            Make sure your terminal is set to UTF-8.
            Your terminal will need to be at least 121x61 or the game will abort.
            If at all possible, use a font with characters that are 8 x 12 pixels, or have a similar
            aspect ratio.

            Some fonts misrender the "full-square" block characters and leave a pixel of background behind.
            Try to use a different one if yours does this.
            

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.py" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py
